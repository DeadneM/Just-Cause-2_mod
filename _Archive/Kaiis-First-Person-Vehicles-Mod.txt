This is basically just the JC2FPS first person mod with only the vehicles being first person. Press C to switch between the two.



First person mods can never be perfect in a third person game. This is the very best you are going to get!



If you find any inevitable bugs in such a prolific mod, please report them here:

Be sure to check out the JC2FPS mod - the only mod that transforms the entire game into first person!
